TODO

1. Check if there is some post processing (within the kernel) when the ring buffer is full.
    If there will be a count associated with an address if it is accessed many times.

    Also, whether the kernle is also doing something.


2. Dont save to file
    PIPE it to SK_D.
    The frequency of the profiler and when SK_D is triggered should be different



The migration of pages should be at 60 seconds.. at least.
